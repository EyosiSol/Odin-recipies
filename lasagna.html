    <h2>Order of Baking</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the ingredients:</strong> Gather all the necessary
        ingredients for your lasagna recipe. This typically includes pasta, meat
        sauce, cheese, and any additional vegetables or seasonings you prefer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the pasta:</strong>Boil the lasagna noodles according to
        the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain the noodles and
        set them aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Layer the ingredients:</strong> Start by spreading a thin layer
        of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Then, place a layer of
        cooked lasagna noodles on top. Add another layer of meat sauce, followed
        by a layer of cheese. Repeat this process until you have used all the
        ingredients, ending with a layer of cheese on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Smooth and press: </strong>After each layer, use a spatula or
        the back of a spoon to smooth and press down the ingredients. This will
        help create a more orderly and compact lasagna.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake:</strong>Preheat your oven to the recommended temperature
        for your lasagna recipe. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and
        bake for the specified time. Remove the foil during the last few minutes
        of baking to allow the cheese to brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rest and serve: </strong>Once the lasagna is cooked, let it rest
        for a few minutes before serving. This will help the layers set and make
        it easier to cut into neat portions.
      </li>
