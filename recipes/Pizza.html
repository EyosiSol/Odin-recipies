          </li>
          <li>
           Gradually add flour to the yeast mixture and knead until a smooth dough forms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the dough rise for a couple of hours or until it doubles in size.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat your oven to the desired temperature (usually around 450°F or 230°C).
