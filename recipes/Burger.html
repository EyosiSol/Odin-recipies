        <strong><em>Burgers: </em></strong>
        are a beloved culinary delight, consisting of a juicy meat patty
        sandwiched between two soft buns. They are often topped with various
        ingredients like lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cheese, making them a
        customizable treat for every palate. The combination of flavors and
        textures creates a satisfying experience with each bite. Fun Fact: Did
        you know that the largest burger ever made weighed a whopping 2,014
        pounds? It was created in 2012 and required a massive custom-built grill
        to cook it! Burgers have become an iconic symbol of American fast food
        culture, with countless variations and styles available worldwide.
        Whether enjoyed at a backyard barbecue or a trendy burger joint, these
        handheld delights never fail to satisfy cravings and bring people
        together.

      <h2>Order of Baking</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Choose the Meat: :</strong> Start by selecting the type of meat
          you want to use for your burger. The best burgers are made from freshly
          ground, high-grade beef chuck in an 80/20 mix (meat to fat)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Season the Meat: </strong>Spread the beef out flat and season it
          with salt and pepper. You can also add other ingredients like
          Worcestershire sauce or chopped bacon for extra flavor
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Form the Patties: </strong> Gently shape the seasoned meat into
          patties. Be careful not to overwork the meat, as this can result in
          tough patties. Make sure the patties are evenly shaped and of the
          desired thickness
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare the Buns: </strong>Choose the type of bun you prefer for
          your burger. Soft patties made with mince or veggies work better with
          soft buns like seeded buns, brioche, milk buns, or potato buns. Denser
          bread such as ciabatta buns can work well with steak or chicken burgers
          . Toast the cut side of the bun under a grill or in a hot, dry pan to
          add crunch and prevent the bun from becoming soggy
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Layer the Condiments: </strong>Once the patties are cooked, it's
          time to assemble the burger. Start by layering the condiments on the
          bottom bun. Common condiments include burger sauce, ketchup, mustard,
          mayonnaise, barbecue sauce, and pickle juice .
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Add Toppings:</strong> After the condiments, add your desired
          toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, bacon, or any
          other toppings you prefer. The order of toppings can vary depending on
          personal preference.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Finish with the Top Bun: </strong>Finally, place the top bun on
          the assembled burger, pressing it gently to hold everything together.
        </li>
