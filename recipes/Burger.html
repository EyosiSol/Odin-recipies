      <li>1/2 cup canola or vegetable oil or avocado oil (120ml)</li>
      <li>1 cup granulated sugar (300g)</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, room temperature preferred</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour (375g)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 cup buttermilk, room temperature preferred (300m)</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h2>Order of Baking</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Choose the Meat: :</strong> Start by selecting the type of meat you want to use for your burger. The best burgers are made from freshly ground, high-grade beef chuck in an 80/20 mix (meat to fat) 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Season the Meat: </strong>Spread the beef out flat and season it with salt and pepper. You can also add other ingredients like Worcestershire sauce or chopped bacon for extra flavor 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Form the Patties: </strong> Gently shape the seasoned meat into patties. Be careful not to overwork the meat, as this can result in tough patties. Make sure the patties are evenly shaped and of the desired thickness 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Buns: </strong>Choose the type of bun you prefer for your burger. Soft patties made with mince or veggies work better with soft buns like seeded buns, brioche, milk buns, or potato buns. Denser bread such as ciabatta buns can work well with steak or chicken burgers . Toast the cut side of the bun under a grill or in a hot, dry pan to add crunch and prevent the bun from becoming soggy 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Layer the Condiments: </strong>Once the patties are cooked, it's time to assemble the burger. Start by layering the condiments on the bottom bun. Common condiments include burger sauce, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, barbecue sauce, and pickle juice .
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add Toppings:</strong> After the condiments, add your desired toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, bacon, or any other toppings you prefer. The order of toppings can vary depending on personal preference.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Finish with the Top Bun: </strong>Finally, place the top bun on the assembled burger, pressing it gently to hold everything together.
      </li>
      
    </ol>
