        <h2>Order of Baking</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Start by preparing the protein. If using ground beef, cook it in a skillet over medium heat until browned. Make sure to break it up into small crumbles as it cooks. If using a different protein, such as chicken or pork, cook it according to your preferred method (grilling, baking, etc.) until it's fully cooked and tender.</li>
          <li>Once the protein is cooked, add taco seasoning to enhance the flavor. You can use a pre-packaged taco seasoning mix or make your own by combining spices like chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix the seasoning well into the cooked protein and let it simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
          <li>While the protein is simmering, warm the tortillas. You can do this by heating them directly on a stovetop burner over low heat for a few seconds on each side until they become pliable. Alternatively, you can wrap them in a damp paper towel and microwave them for a few seconds.</li>
          <li>Once the tortillas are warm, it's time to assemble the tacos. Take a tortilla and place a generous amount of the seasoned protein in the center. Spread it out to create an even layer.</li>
          <li>Next, add your desired toppings. This can include shredded cheese, lettuce, diced tomatoes, sliced onions, chopped cilantro, salsa, guacamole, and sour cream. Feel free to get creative and add any other toppings you enjoy. Layer the toppings on top of the protein, making sure to distribute them evenly.</li>
          <li>Finally, fold the tortilla over the filling to create a taco shape. You can secure it with a toothpick if needed. Repeat the assembly process for the remaining tortillas and filling.</li>
          <li>Now, it's time to enjoy your delicious homemade tacos! Serve them immediately and savor the combination of flavors and textures in each bite.</li>
